## Design: 
The SDK is structured around a set of core classes and interfaces, such as Service, Request, and LOTR.  
Each Service represents a specific endpoint of the API (e.g., MovieService, QuoteService), and encapsulates the logic for fetching and updating data from that endpoint.  
The Request class is responsible for sending HTTP requests to the API, while the LOTR class serves as the main entry point for clients to interact with the SDK.

## Data Fetching and Caching:
Each Service periodically fetches data from its corresponding API endpoint and caches the data locally. This reduces the number of API calls and improves performance by serving data from the cache whenever possible. The update frequency is configurable and can be adjusted based on the needs of the application.

## Pagination Handling:
The SDK handles pagination automatically. When a Service fetches data from an API endpoint, it checks if the response includes a pagination token or link. If so, it sends additional requests to fetch all pages of data, ensuring that the client receives a complete dataset.

## Rate Limit Handling:
Due to the use of local caching the SDK will remain compliant with the API's usage policies. 

## Flexible Querying:
The `get` method in the LOTR class allows clients to fetch data from a specific Service and apply filters to the data. The filters are defined using a flexible syntax that supports various comparison operators (e.g., 'lt', 'gt', 'eq') and can be applied to any field of the data.

## Type Safety: 
The SDK is written in TypeScript and makes extensive use of generics and type guards to ensure type safety. This helps prevent bugs and makes the SDK easier to use and maintain.

## Scalability: 
The SDK is designed to be easily scalable. To add a new endpoint, you simply need to create a new Service class for that endpoint and add it to the Service map in the LOTR class. The rest of the SDK's infrastructure will automatically handle data fetching, caching, pagination, rate limits, and querying for the new Service.
